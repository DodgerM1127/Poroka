Add your site images here.

Usage:
- Place image files directly in this folder (e.g., `photo1.jpg`).
- Reference them from HTML/JSX as `/images/photo1.jpg` or use Next.js `next/image` with `src="/images/photo1.jpg"`.

Tip: keep file names lowercase and use `-` for spaces (e.g., `gaja-matej-ceremony.jpg`).
